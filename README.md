# Beast Feast Dice Roller

## About
A companion app to the Beast Feast Daggerheart campaign setting for rolling.  Choose the number/type of dice to roll and it will roll them all, calculating the total representing the shared pool to regain health and stress.

### Behaviour:
1. Input the number of each die type you want to roll
2. Take the value of all pairs to add towards the total (ex. if you rolled 2 4s, add 4 to the total)
  - If no pairs are rolled, remove the die that rolled the lowest
3. Remove all pairs from the dice pool if any
4. Reroll remaining dice
5. Continue until there is only 1 die remaining in the dice pool
